## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3

### What I learned

I learned basic HTML5 and CSS3. How to implement it to create this project.

### Continued development

I want to refactor the current code using best practices from developers community. Also style the component according to BEM methodology. In addition, in the design file, there are some good features like circles in QR code itself. I think it will be good practice, if those circles can be animated using JS or plain CSS3.
